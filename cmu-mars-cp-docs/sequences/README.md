Sequence diagrams generated from `*.mmd` by
[MermaidJS](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). `convert.sh` will recreate all
of them, for convenience. Do not edit the PNGs directly; edit the `mmd` and
then check in the regenerated diagram. To run MermaidJS, you'll need to
install `npm` and `phantomjs` in an OS specific way, then `npm install -g
mermaid` at the command line.
