Autonomy should provide mechanisms to provide system-level verification. For example, queries from the Autonomy evaluator, to verify whether the plan generation was aware of the fault injection parameters before test execution. In particular, the autonomy may provide verifications using a combination of static verification (via code analysis) and online dynamic verification (via runtime introspection).
